/*code explanation
    The loop starts with i = 0 and goes until the end of choices.
    In each iteration, it generates a random index shuffleMethod within the length of choices.
    Then it swaps the element at index i with the element at index shuffleMethod.
    For example, if this.choices.length is 4 and Math.random() returns 0.7 => 0.7 * 4 = 2.8. floor returns 2
    Without multiplication, Math.random() only returns values between 0 and 1, which wouldn’t allow us to access all indixe values of an array with more than one element.
    By scaling up to this.choices.length, the range is expanded to cover the entire array.
    this.choices[i] accesses the element at index i.
    this.choices[shuffleMethod] accesses the element at the randomly generated index

    Start from the last element and swap 
    // one by one. We don't need to run for 
    // the first element that's why i > 0 
    for (let i = arr.length - 1; i > 0; i--)
        {
            // Pick a random index from 0 to i inclusive
            let j = Math.floor(Math.random() * (i + 1)); 
            // Swap arr[i] with the element 
            // at random index 
            [arr[i], arr[j]] = [arr[j], arr[i]];
        }

      shuffleChoices() {
    for (let i = this.choices.length - 1; i > 0; i--) {
      const j = Math.floor(Math.random() * (i + 1)); // Pick a random index
